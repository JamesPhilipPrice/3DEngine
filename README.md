# 3DEngine
 A 3D game engine using OpenGL and SDL

## Project start: 03/02/21
I have managed to get the project set up and a basic scene rendered without any objects. There is currently an issue with rendering a triangle (nothing is visible (Fixed: 08/02/21))

## Bug Fix: 08/02/21
The issue was caused by not having the GL context versions set correctly. The issue was fixed a few days ago but only just pushed.
